# Mask and Shader Cardboard

**Building a “reality hacker” style application in Unity to learn Git, Shader Graph, and compute shaders**

During Global Game Jam, I supported students during the day and spent the nights developing a *Reality Hacker–style* application in Unity.

This project is a tribute to the following app:   
[https://reality-hacker-vr.fr.softonic.com/android](https://reality-hacker-vr.fr.softonic.com/android)     
Context: [https://reality-hacker-vr.updatestar.com](https://reality-hacker-vr.updatestar.com)  

The original app is no longer maintained on the Google Play Store.     
With the jam’s theme *Mask* and my goal of recreating this experience one day,    
the timing felt right to finally work on it.    

This repository includes a collection of texturing and shader tools to help understand and build this type of application. Two versions are provided:  

* an **XR version for Quest 3**  
* a **Cardboard version**  
  
Hope you enjoy exploring it.
